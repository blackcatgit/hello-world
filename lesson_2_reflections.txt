1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository the current folder starts to be tracked by git
and receives a special folder .git where metadata about commits are stored.
If I don't initialize a repository git wont keep track of it and I cannot
make commits in it.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Repository is the area where all of my commits are stored, it only contains
stuff that I put in there organized in time by order of commits. Working
directory is the place where I add and edit files while I work on them and
these are saved in a repository only when I make a commit, otherwise they
remain unsaved. A staging area is a kind of a cache where I put edited and
added files before I make a commit so that it can include all of the things
I worked on not only one. That way I do not need to add one file at a time
if the change I made was done on multiple files at once.
